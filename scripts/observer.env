# Miru-Log observer (EXE) minimal config
# Place this as dist/.env next to mirulog-observer.exe
#
# Recommended for multi-PC usage:
# - Run observer on multiple PCs (capture only)
# - Keep ARCHIVE_ROOT per PC (via %COMPUTERNAME%) so SQLite DB is NOT shared

# Observer does not use analyzer, but keeping it explicit avoids surprises.
ANALYZER_BACKEND=local

# Paths are resolved relative to current working directory.
# If your shortcut's "Start in" is the dist folder, these will become dist/data/...
#
# You can also use environment variable expansion, e.g.:
#   CAPTURE_ROOT=data/captures/%COMPUTERNAME%
#   ARCHIVE_ROOT=data/archive/%COMPUTERNAME%
CAPTURE_ROOT=data/captures/%COMPUTERNAME%
ARCHIVE_ROOT=data/archive/%COMPUTERNAME%

CAPTURE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60
IDLE_THRESHOLD_MINUTES=5
